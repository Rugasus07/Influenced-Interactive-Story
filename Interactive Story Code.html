        <h1>Influenced: The Cursed Promise</h1>
        <p>“I cannot believe this!” exclaimed Rugasus, “they expect us to seriously pick this up literally right after dealing with the likes of Dirvana!”</p>
        <p>“Calm down Rug, we simply can’t sweep this under the desk if it is worth this much.” bargained Tylinus. The crew were all back safely on their base after the nightmare that was Dirvana, a being able to control reality at his will, barely able to escape with their lives. Their familiar base was formed on the back of recently formed volcanic rock, all mostly grayish black. A man-made beach rests at the base of the island, with it idly accepting the embrace of the water that flows onto it. Overlooking the events below was the watchtower Yveta constructed herself, as she did not find her current abode to be satisfactory. The ATC tower kept a watchful eye of the skies, despite the fact no one was present to make any use of the information on the monitors. Then there was the main hub, four stories high and full of tense energy, as if the atmosphere itself was able to push you slightly in the other direction.</p>
        <p>“Like I could care about their problems, I need a damn break anyway!” exclaimed Rugasus once more.</p>
        <p>“Come on, it can’t be that hard,” pushed Tylinus, “it's only in the city of Virba; from what I’ve heard, it's not that bad of city.”</p>
        <p>“Could you all calm down, this is the most we have ever argued over a job and it’s starting to get annoying.” Kaina said as he entered the room. His special mask completely obscuring his face and distorting his voice.</p>
        <p> “Like to add anything else to this long list of bull I have to put up with today.” said Rugasus as he casually leans against the wall.</p>
        <p>“Yes, actually, I think ever since the job with Dirvana, you’ve been afraid to take another high paying job.” stated Kaina. Rugasus shot him the sharpest stare he could give, as if his eyes were able to set fire to Kaina. “I mean truly, after going through the trauma of fighting Viridian with his summonable zombie companions and Dirvana with the power to alter reality at his whim, you’re afraid to find out what else you may find.” said Kaina, sarcastically.</p>
        <p>“As if I would be afraid to back down from the likes of their puny “magic”, you should know, I was the one who saved everyone as they were cowering in the corner.” fired back Rugasus.</p>
        <p>“If my memory serves well, I believe it was Yveta that was the MVP of our little scuffle with Dirvana.” said Wenter as he walks in with Yveta.</p>
        <p>Rugasus scoffs and said, “Yeah, whatever, truly the saviour of the world.” Yveta casually sticks her tounge out at him, she did so looking like a teenager fresh out of bed with her messed up purple hair and black beanie with gold stripes running the circumference of it.</p>
        <p>Ferelia walks in after overhearing the conversation and snatches the dossier from Tylinus’s hands. “Hey, you could ask first.” said Tylinus condescendingly.</p>
        <p>Ferelia exhales, “Yeah yeah whatever.”  She examines the paper closely and her eyes lit up, “Oh yeah, I’ve heard of this place, never actually been there myself but Virba is probably a hermit city.”</p>
        <p>“What’s your meaning?” asks Tylinus.</p>
        <p>“I used to see these kinds of places a lot, but this is especially bad keeping what it is a secret, a giant proxy state to fuel the ambition of whoever the figure head on top is.” States Ferelia.</p>
        <p>“And will you ever tell us where you see these kinds of places from.” asks Tylinus, not really expecting an answer.</p>
        <p>Ferelia pauses, then said, “Nope.” She then turns around and leaves the room. Her red orange hair flowing perfectly on her exit.</p>
        <p>“Alright, back on topic,” said Tylinus, “What's the plan for Virba.”</p>,

        text : `Kaina sighs and looks towards Tylinus, “What kind of specializations do we need for this one.”
“Details are scarce, but all we know is that the client wants the VIP kicked from his position in his dictatorship.” explained tylinus
“They want him dead or alive?” asks Wenter
“Either or…” Tylinus started
Rugasus cuts him off and said, “Dead it is, so we got an objective, but who’s going?”
Kaina responds, “I’m not busy, so might as well.”
Tylinus hops in, “Me too”
“Then it’s official, what does the client want, guns blazing, discrete, political execution?” asks Rugasus
“They want us to meet an associate at the Farland bar, the details will be explained in greater detail once they guide us to resistance HQ.” explained Tylinus 
“Cool, you guys have fun, Imma go watch a movie.” said Wenter. On his word Yveta also left the room.
“Okay, we’re running on a tight schedule, wings up in 30, we begin the operation tomorrow.” explains Tylinus.
“Not much time for prep, but I guess.” said Kaina
Koiraze enters the room unaware of the ongoing conversation and said, “Nani ga oki teru?(What’s going on?)”
“Thanks for volunteering your services Koiraze, get ready we leave in 30.” said Rugasus as he walks past her towards the armoury.
“Kontekisuto wa atae raremasenga, sagyō wa watashi kara hitsuyōdesu. (I am given no context, yet work is required from me.)” States Koiraze as she walks back to where she came from to also prepare, her expression never changing.

A large elevator lifts a single craft to the surface of the little island. A hidden opening opens up to reveal the underground industrialization hidden underneath. The craft is spit out the ground and it is now looking over the runway down below. “ATC, would like to have clearance head over 1,489 miles northeast on contract order JTR-X3E, Destination: Virba.” Tylinus radios in.
“Confirm Strander 2-V, 1,489 northeast, C.O. JTR-X3E, Virba, Clearance granted.” Radios back the Intern.
Tylinus looks out into the ocean from the cockpit of the strander, he then radios again, “Do we anything to confirm the status of the Afreimus crew?” 
He waits a few unsettling seconds when the Intern radios back, “Tylinus...stop worrying about your girlfriend, I’m sure they’re just fine, they should be back once your objective has been completed.” Tylinus leans back on the pilots chair and sighs, covering his eyes with his hands. “Now hurry up and get outta here, I got better things to do other than consult you.” radios the Intern again. Tylinus scoffs and gets back on track, he places his left hand on the wheel and flips a few switches. The engines on all four corners of the craft roar to life, all making a trail of heat and sharp flame at the ends as they power up. Tylinus pulls the wheel towards him slightly, doing so caused more air to be forcibly taken from its resting place and forced out the other side. They craft slowly rose from the ground and once at a high enough altitude, the craft leaned forward and gained speed, once it gained enough speed, the engines turned towards the back of the craft and it rocketed towards the open ocean.
“Cruise control enabled,” said a robotic voice from the console. “Eta to Virba City, 3 hours and 43 minutes.” In the cabin, Kaina is lost in his thoughts, memories of Barabel are flowing through his head again. He thinks of all the things he could’ve done differently in order to void the future he laid out for himself.
“Hey Ty, this Farland bar, what kind of neighborhood is it in?” asks Rugasus.
“We don’t have much information on the area,” explains Tylinus heading down into the cabin from the cockpit, “all we know is that the client told us to go in prepared.” Koiraze looks sternly from her seat and only nods in understanding. Rugasus leans into his chair nonchalauntly.
Kaina managed to let out an, “alright.” before becoming consumed his thoughts once more. He continued to see the memories. His best friend, Hijina, him running down the halls, punching a mirror in the bathroom, the old school gates, and the reason he can’t show himself, his own selfish desire. Kaina was left wondering for so long that he had not noticed that they had arrived in the customs area of Virba.
An automated voice said, “Hello sir, from where do you hail.”
“Lysim.” Tylinus responded. He continued to give information as Kaina observed his surroundings. They were in a tunnel specially designed to hold aircraft, with many spaces to serve other people. 
The console said, “Hello, Tylinus, and welcome to Virba, please wait while we configure the port to your craft, we hope you have a wonderful time!” 
“Don’t sound too bad here.” Tylinus said as he gets ready to leave.
“Don’t let your guard down, there could be a lot of ugly behind the mask of the city.” explains Rugasus. The port finally finished configuring and the crew exited the craft.
As they headed towards the exit, a console in the wall said, “Here is your ticket for proof of ownership for you craft. Right now, you are entering Portra Park.” a little slot dispensed a tourist pamphlet and Kaina receives it. As it was naming more places and hotels to stay at, the crew were already walking away. When they reached the surface, they were surprised to find that the “Park” they were presumably supposed to be at, was nothing but flat concrete. Gray fog limited the vision so much that you couldn’t see more than 15 feet in any direction.
“Some park.” retorted Rugasus. “What are supposed to do just walk.” Upon saying this,  he realized that the other three were already walking ahead of them. He gave an expression of disappointing realization and moved to catch up with the group.

The crew were walking when they spotted some buildings up ahead, “So there is a city here after all.” said Rugasus. When they reached the street, it was wide enough to fit 4 lanes of traffic going both ways, but not a single car occupied even a parking space. The lights continued to control traffic despite its absence. The skyscrapers that ran along the sides were lacking any form uniqueness, no lights, no signs, just gray concrete and tinted glass. A man was walking in the opposite direction of the crew, looking as disorganized as a file drawer stuffed with too many papers.`,

The yellow neon lights highlighting the walls, tables with polished wooden finishes, and T.Vs lining the bar showing the latest products from the A.N.T. Sugar Glass, and an unoccupied stage with curtains drawn..
“Hello there, what can I get you four?” asks the Bartender.
“Just waters all around would be fine.” said Tylinus 
“Ahh, that’s boring,” said the Bartender, “suppose you waiting for someone?”
“Guess you could say that.” Rugasus said not fully paying attention.
The bartender scratches his beard and simply answers, “Alright.” The four find a table and sit down around.
“Don’t suppose you could give us some info about the client.” Rugasus said.
“We ain’t got much, just said that we'd meet him here.” explained Tylinus
“What do you mean,” argues Kaina, “I thought we don’t take vague contracts. This could be a trap for all we know.” Right on que, the curtains of the stage opened dramatically.
“You truly z’ink ve vould treat our guests so poorly.” said the man on the stage. He wore dark blue robes with matching pants, white gloves, dress shoes, a hat with an outlandish design, and an umbrella in his hand. Music had started playing upon his entrance. “I’m sure j’ou had already been exposed to ze unique horrors zat zis city had been plagued by.” said the man extravagantly. The Bartender had started to pre-fill drinks.
“Oh yeah,” said Rugasus leaning back in his chair, “What might that be?” 
The man smiles elegantly and raises his hands above his head and yells, “Expression!” Just then, the doors swung open and people began to fill the bar at an alarming rate. The man raises the end of his umbrella to mouth, “Individuality, uniqueness, character, but most important of all, it’s just no fun.” The crowd cheers to his presence. “I vill not sit here and vatch zis, my city, fade avay into obscurity, so ladies and gentlemen, I present to you our main event.” A band quickly assembles on the stage and begins to play vigorously. “The men and vomen here see ze consequences as negligible, and here tonight they vill spill zere heart and soul into zeir art. So sit back, relax, and release every ounce of pent up energy have into zis night!” The crowd cheered again and form a dance floor in the center of the bar and begin to dance wildly. The crew stand up trying to see over the crowd but get separated.`,

        text : `Rugasus was already busy getting into slugfests with the Gray-suits and Koiraze was hitting them with the dull side of her sword.
Tylinus linked up with Kaina said to the man from the stage, “What’s going on.”
The man replies, “zey are here to crash my party.”
A Gray-suit approached them and said, “Surrender yourself, you have no right to be here!”
“Ah, but alas, it vould seem zat I have my right, right here-” said the man. The gray-suit gave a confused look for a split second before being thrusted upon by the end of the man's umbrella and being subdued by the butt end of it. The man calls out to the rest of the group, “Come, my friends, zis vay!” Rugasus and Koiraze fell back towards the back exit. Before the gray-suits could catch up, the man opened his umbrella and flashed them with more than 10,000 lumens, he then retreated and closed the door and proceeded to barricade in with a nearby shelf.
The crew were running down an underground canal, lit only by an open flame lantern carried by the man. Rugasus asks, “Who are you?”
The man responds, “The names Brozuire, and I vill be your client for today.”
“What?” said Kaina.
“I vill explain later, first ve need to make sure ve lose ze heat, zen I vill explain everything ven I deliver j’ou to headquarters.” Brozuire said hastily.

A door opens in a dark room and the foggy light flows into it. Brozuire peers around the frame for a moment and said in a hushed voice, “It is clear, go!” The crew go in with Brozuire going last and shutting the door and hanging the lantern on the wall. He then walks up to the door on the opposite side and bangs on it multiple times. A voice said, “Yes, can I help you?” 
“You know, you could’ve done your part in taking out ze trash, but I don’t need your help, I can do it myself!” yelled Brozuire. They waited a bit to see what would happen, then the door opened and a child no more than 13 peered out.
“Brozuire,” said the child, running up to hug him.
“Awww, did I scare you little Frenta.”
“Y-Yeah, I heard what happened, we were so worried.” said Frenta
“It’s okay, I'm here now, now vhere is your sister, ve have important business to attend to.” whispered Brozuire. 
“Oh-This way.” pointed Frenta. Brozuire gestured to the group to follow. Inside, the crew observed a large scale operation being enacted. Cars were being maintenanced, plans were being discussed, weapons were being stored, and food was being distributed. “In there.” pointed Frenta.
Brozuire patted her head, “Good girl, now run along and spread ze news zat our VIP’s have arrived.” She nodded her head and ran off. Brozuire moved aside a curtain in a doorway and gestures again to follow. Heavy talk emanated from the room. Upon entering the room, a table showing the whole map of the city is seen in the center of the room, many people were around it debating plans and whatnot. A woman at the end of the table sees that Brozuire had entered.
“Who are these guy’s Brozuire?” she said sternly.
“Madame, zees are ze guest ve asked so graciously to be a part of our plans going forward.” explained Brozuire. The room is instantly drowned in chatter.
The woman looks in interest, she then said, “This meeting is adjourned.” The crowd vacates the room. Only Brozuire, the crew, and the woman are left in the room. “So...sources say you are the legendary mercenaries.”
“Well, that’s truly flattering, but what on what claims, what makes you so sure we are not just regular mercenaries?” interrogated Kaina.
The woman stares for a moment and answers, “You guys were the ones that put a stop to the B.U.B.B.L.E Rogue.”
“Well-” Kaina said.
“And you were the ones who took down Viridian and restored Fallen’s power.” remarked the woman.
“These are some pretty bold claims, but everyone knows that the FFORMLESS FFEAR took care of both of those.” counters Kaina.
“Their files would say otherwise.” retorts the woman.
“This is ridiculous,” said Rugasus slamming his hands on the table, “there’s no way you could have access to FFORMLESS FFEAR files.”
“Well they were pretty easy to get a hold of.” said the woman.
“How?” asks Tylinus
“After a little legal argument after Fallens power was lost, a lot of files were declassified, including the ones mentioning the individuals cleaning up all their messes.” The crew bowed their heads in disappointment.
“Whatever the case, who are you, and what do you want?” asks Rugasus sternly.
“Vell, allow me to introduce you to ze leader of ze resistance group Formatia, Lytheys.” Brozuire remarked.
“And we would want you to work with us in toppling the man at the top of the hierarchy, Jotaque, from power.” finished Lytheys. 
They all stared at one another for a moment, and Rugasus said, “I guess, we came this far for how much?”
“Ve are villing to offer a 350,000 Rulta, for your services.” answers Brozuire.
“Well I’m game,” said Kaina, “What’s the plan?”
“First things first,” Lytheys responded, “You two, take off your masks.” She was pointing towards Koiraze and Kaina. The crew cringed at the idea of having Kaina take off his mask, especially in the presence of a woman. “I need to be able to trust you, show me who you really are.” explains Lytheys.
Koiraze takes off her mask and said, “Anata ga anata no jinsei no saidai no kutsujoku o kanjitainara, watashi no gesuto ni naru. (if you wish to feel the greatest humiliation of your life, then be my guest)” She then proceeds to leave the room.
“What did she say?” asks Lytheys 
“Oh, we don’t know.” responded Rugasus, “what we do know is that you don’t want Kaina to take off his mask, especially in the presence of a...feminine figure”
“What do mean, explain?” ordered Lytheys 
“It’s not particularly something we would like to explain in this professional setting.” explained Tylinus.
“I don’t care about the reason, we are short on time and I need people I can trust, you want your payment, then take off the mask.” commanded Lytheys. Rugasus and Tylinus both nod agreement to Kaina and head over to the other side of the table.`,

“Why there?” asked Kaina.
“It vas apparently built by her father, she even helped vith a brick or two.” answered Brozuire. “Perhaps you can fetch her for me, our vindow is closing fast, and ve vill need our leader leading ze operation.”
“Got it.” Kaina said as he unholsters his lever actions and uses the recoil of firing them periodically in order to fly.
“I have not seen zat ever in my life.” Brozuire said as he watches a physics defying man flying off into absurdity. The clock tower was not hard to spot as it was a different building architecturally compared to the rest of the city. It was unfinished, and a large portion of the roof was missing. Kaina flew into the opening and slid across the wooden floor. He looked around and found Lytheys sitting down at the edge of the tower, observing the non-active city.`,

It widens as it gets to the base, with guards covering every occupiable space around it. The roads leading into the building were still made of dirt and mud with tractors and dump-trucks regular working the road. A convoy of trucks ran through and stopped at the entrance.
“Zis is not vhat’s supposed to happen.” said Brozuire scouting the area on top of a dirt hill with the reflective side of his umbrella.
“What’s the status?” urges Rugasus from below.
“ze shipment vas supposed to be one of great importance, but zis is just a regular convoy.” explained Brozuire, not taking his eye off his umbrella.
