        <h1>Influenced: The Cursed Promise</h1>
        <p>“I cannot believe this!” exclaimed Rugasus, “they expect us to seriously pick this up literally right after dealing with the likes of Dirvana!”</p>
        <p>“Calm down Rug, we simply can’t sweep this under the desk if it is worth this much.” bargained Tylinus. The crew were all back safely on their base after the nightmare that was Dirvana, a being able to control reality at his will, barely able to escape with their lives. Their familiar base was formed on the back of recently formed volcanic rock, all mostly grayish black. A man-made beach rests at the base of the island, with it idly accepting the embrace of the water that flows onto it. Overlooking the events below was the watchtower Yveta constructed herself, as she did not find her current abode to be satisfactory. The ATC tower kept a watchful eye of the skies, despite the fact no one was present to make any use of the information on the monitors. Then there was the main hub, four stories high and full of tense energy, as if the atmosphere itself was able to push you slightly in the other direction.</p>
        <p>“Like I could care about their problems, I need a damn break anyway!” exclaimed Rugasus once more.</p>
        <p>“Come on, it can’t be that hard,” pushed Tylinus, “it's only in the city of Virba; from what I’ve heard, it's not that bad of city.”</p>
        <p>“Could you all calm down, this is the most we have ever argued over a job and it’s starting to get annoying.” Kaina said as he entered the room. His special mask completely obscuring his face and distorting his voice.</p>
        <p> “Like to add anything else to this long list of bull I have to put up with today.” said Rugasus as he casually leans against the wall.</p>
        <p>“Yes, actually, I think ever since the job with Dirvana, you’ve been afraid to take another high paying job.” stated Kaina. Rugasus shot him the sharpest stare he could give, as if his eyes were able to set fire to Kaina. “I mean truly, after going through the trauma of fighting Viridian with his summonable zombie companions and Dirvana with the power to alter reality at his whim, you’re afraid to find out what else you may find.” said Kaina, sarcastically.</p>
        <p>“As if I would be afraid to back down from the likes of their puny “magic”, you should know, I was the one who saved everyone as they were cowering in the corner.” fired back Rugasus.</p>
        <p>“If my memory serves well, I believe it was Yveta that was the MVP of our little scuffle with Dirvana.” said Wenter as he walks in with Yveta.</p>
        <p>Rugasus scoffs and said, “Yeah, whatever, truly the saviour of the world.” Yveta casually sticks her tounge out at him, she did so looking like a teenager fresh out of bed with her messed up purple hair and black beanie with gold stripes running the circumference of it.</p>
        <p>Ferelia walks in after overhearing the conversation and snatches the dossier from Tylinus’s hands. “Hey, you could ask first.” said Tylinus condescendingly.</p>
        <p>Ferelia exhales, “Yeah yeah whatever.”  She examines the paper closely and her eyes lit up, “Oh yeah, I’ve heard of this place, never actually been there myself but Virba is probably a hermit city.”</p>
        <p>“What’s your meaning?” asks Tylinus.</p>
        <p>“I used to see these kinds of places a lot, but this is especially bad keeping what it is a secret, a giant proxy state to fuel the ambition of whoever the figure head on top is.” States Ferelia.</p>
        <p>“And will you ever tell us where you see these kinds of places from.” asks Tylinus, not really expecting an answer.</p>
        <p>Ferelia pauses, then said, “Nope.” She then turns around and leaves the room. Her red orange hair flowing perfectly on her exit.</p>
        <p>“Alright, back on topic,” said Tylinus, “What's the plan for Virba.”</p>,

        let exoPath = `Kaina sighs and looks towards Tylinus, “What kind of specializations do we need for this one.”
“Details are scarce, but all we know is that the client wants the VIP kicked from his position in his dictatorship.” explained tylinus
“They want him dead or alive?” asks Wenter
“Either or…” Tylinus started
Rugasus cuts him off and said, “Dead it is, so we got an objective, but who’s going?”
Kaina responds, “I’m not busy, so might as well.”
Tylinus hops in, “Me too”
“Then it’s official, what does the client want, guns blazing, discrete, political execution?” asks Rugasus
“They want us to meet an associate at the Farland bar, the details will be explained in greater detail once they guide us to resistance HQ.” explained Tylinus 
“Cool, you guys have fun, Imma go watch a movie.” said Wenter. On his word Yveta also left the room.
“Okay, we’re running on a tight schedule, wings up in 30, we begin the operation tomorrow.” explains Tylinus.
“Not much time for prep, but I guess.” said Kaina
Koiraze enters the room unaware of the ongoing conversation and said, “Nani ga oki teru?(What’s going on?)”
“Thanks for volunteering your services Koiraze, get ready we leave in 30.” said Rugasus as he walks past her towards the armoury.
“Kontekisuto wa atae raremasenga, sagyō wa watashi kara hitsuyōdesu. (I am given no context, yet work is required from me.)” States Koiraze as she walks back to where she came from to also prepare, her expression never changing.

A large elevator lifts a single craft to the surface of the little island. A hidden opening opens up to reveal the underground industrialization hidden underneath. The craft is spit out the ground and it is now looking over the runway down below. “ATC, would like to have clearance head over 1,489 miles northeast on contract order JTR-X3E, Destination: Virba.” Tylinus radios in.
“Confirm Strander 2-V, 1,489 northeast, C.O. JTR-X3E, Virba, Clearance granted.” Radios back the Intern.
Tylinus looks out into the ocean from the cockpit of the strander, he then radios again, “Do we anything to confirm the status of the Afreimus crew?” 
He waits a few unsettling seconds when the Intern radios back, “Tylinus...stop worrying about your girlfriend, I’m sure they’re just fine, they should be back once your objective has been completed.” Tylinus leans back on the pilots chair and sighs, covering his eyes with his hands. “Now hurry up and get outta here, I got better things to do other than consult you.” radios the Intern again. Tylinus scoffs and gets back on track, he places his left hand on the wheel and flips a few switches. The engines on all four corners of the craft roar to life, all making a trail of heat and sharp flame at the ends as they power up. Tylinus pulls the wheel towards him slightly, doing so caused more air to be forcibly taken from its resting place and forced out the other side. They craft slowly rose from the ground and once at a high enough altitude, the craft leaned forward and gained speed, once it gained enough speed, the engines turned towards the back of the craft and it rocketed towards the open ocean.
“Cruise control enabled,” said a robotic voice from the console. “Eta to Virba City, 3 hours and 43 minutes.” In the cabin, Kaina is lost in his thoughts, memories of Barabel are flowing through his head again. He thinks of all the things he could’ve done differently in order to void the future he laid out for himself.
“Hey Ty, this Farland bar, what kind of neighborhood is it in?” asks Rugasus.
“We don’t have much information on the area,” explains Tylinus heading down into the cabin from the cockpit, “all we know is that the client told us to go in prepared.” Koiraze looks sternly from her seat and only nods in understanding. Rugasus leans into his chair nonchalauntly.
Kaina managed to let out an, “alright.” before becoming consumed his thoughts once more. He continued to see the memories. His best friend, Hijina, him running down the halls, punching a mirror in the bathroom, the old school gates, and the reason he can’t show himself, his own selfish desire. Kaina was left wondering for so long that he had not noticed that they had arrived in the customs area of Virba.
An automated voice said, “Hello sir, from where do you hail.”
“Lysim.” Tylinus responded. He continued to give information as Kaina observed his surroundings. They were in a tunnel specially designed to hold aircraft, with many spaces to serve other people. 
The console said, “Hello, Tylinus, and welcome to Virba, please wait while we configure the port to your craft, we hope you have a wonderful time!” 
“Don’t sound too bad here.” Tylinus said as he gets ready to leave.
“Don’t let your guard down, there could be a lot of ugly behind the mask of the city.” explains Rugasus. The port finally finished configuring and the crew exited the craft.
As they headed towards the exit, a console in the wall said, “Here is your ticket for proof of ownership for you craft. Right now, you are entering Portra Park.” a little slot dispensed a tourist pamphlet and Kaina receives it. As it was naming more places and hotels to stay at, the crew were already walking away. When they reached the surface, they were surprised to find that the “Park” they were presumably supposed to be at, was nothing but flat concrete. Gray fog limited the vision so much that you couldn’t see more than 15 feet in any direction.
“Some park.” retorted Rugasus. “What are supposed to do just walk.” Upon saying this,  he realized that the other three were already walking ahead of them. He gave an expression of disappointing realization and moved to catch up with the group.

The crew were walking when they spotted some buildings up ahead, “So there is a city here after all.” said Rugasus. When they reached the street, it was wide enough to fit 4 lanes of traffic going both ways, but not a single car occupied even a parking space. The lights continued to control traffic despite its absence. The skyscrapers that ran along the sides were lacking any form uniqueness, no lights, no signs, just gray concrete and tinted glass. A man was walking in the opposite direction of the crew, looking as disorganized as a file drawer stuffed with too many papers.`

let agrPath = `Talk envelops the group soon after and it was interrupted almost as fast as it started by Kaina stating, “Fine I’ll do it myself, it’s not like I need your help anyway.”
Tylinus tries to calm Kaina down, “No, we need to go as a team, we can’t go alone if the reward is this high, too risky. Me and Rugasus will go with you” Rugasus looks towards tylinus showing that he didn’t want to be dragged into this.`

let cowPath = `“Look, we already had to deal with reality shifters and zombie masters, I say we skip it.” explained Kaina.
“I’d say for once I agree with him.” stated Rugasus.
“But-” started Tylinus
“No buts,” interrupted Kaina, “I need a break, I have to deal with the fact that our greatest trump card might be useless against another user of the magic arts. So you know what, I’m out.” Kaina then leaves the room without a second thought. (That’s It? Ending)`

let thatsIt = `Upon passing up the contract, there is no story to tell. Like, really, the filler doesn't even start until the next game. The only thing we can say is that they got bored and left. Nothing, no fight, no conflict, no interaction. So here is your reward, the one ending you don’t have to beat the game for.`
    
let heoPath = `Talk envelops the group soon after and it was interrupted almost as fast as it started by Rugasus stating, “Forget it, lets just go.”
“Well that was a quick 180, have I influenced you that much.” Kaina retorted.
“First, your statement is invalid, second, shut up.” Rugasus said back`
